Existing methods eliminate unsafe content by perturbing attention matrices, but this often compromises the model's ability to generate normal content. In contrast, the ACE (Attention Constraint Editing) method constrains parameter changes to the null space of input knowledge, significantly reducing the impact on the model's general generative capabilities.
